                Metal stock tends to come in sheets, bars, rods, and tubes.
                <br><br>Depending on the form factor of the metal stock you are using determines the type of tools and processes used to work with it.
                <br><br>For instance, thin sheet metal requires a very different set of tools to cut, shaped and bend it than square tubing. That said, the general principles we discuss in this class remain roughly consistent.

                The most common types of metal you will encounter while doing metalworking are steel, stainless steel and aluminum.
                <br><br><b>Steel</b> is an alloy of iron and carbon. Alloys are combinations of pure elemental metals that when combined together create metals with new and different properties. In the case of steel, adding carbon to the iron creates
                more strength. Steel is typically ferromagnetic, meaning magnets can stick to it, and it can be magnetized. Carbon steel also oxidizes (rusts) and needs to be treated to prevent this from happening. It is considered a harder metal, and
                usually falls somewhere between stainless steel and aluminum. The steel stock you will most encounter will be low carbon (mild) steel. It will also be hot or cold rolled, but you can learn much more about that in the welding class.
                <br><br><b>Stainless steel</b> is a steel alloy with chromium added in. The addition of chromium enables the steel to resist oxidation in most situations, thus preventing tarnish and rust. Stainless steel is typically not ferromagnetic
                as a general rule, but certain types sometimes are. In addition, stainless steel is typically less brittle than steel, but it ultimately depends on the different steel and stainless steel alloys that are being compared.
                <br><br><b>Aluminum</b> is an elemental metal and has the symbol Al on the periodic table. Aluminum typically oxidizes very little and does not rust. However, you may see aluminum tarnish a little as it corrodes. Aluminum is not ferromagnetic.
                The nice thing about aluminum is that it is a soft malleable metal and is easy to machine. However, it is a little more expensive than steel, easier to dent, and more difficult to weld.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center mb-100">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/metal_sk/metal3.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p class="sample-text">
                You may also encounter brass, and copper.
                <br><br><b>Brass</b> is a yellowish metal alloy made of copper and zinc. It is a soft metal and is typically softer than aluminum. Brass oxidizes by tarnishing, much in the same way a piece of fine silver might. In other words, it loses
                its luster and gets darker. It is not ferromagnetic. Brass is often found in plumbing. However, it is most commonly used as a decorative metal on account of its color.
                <br><br><b>Copper</b> is another elemental metal. It is a soft metal like aluminum, but arguably slightly harder as a general rule. When copper oxidizes it tarnishes and then turns green on account of a buildup of copper carbonate that
                is a result of its interactions with the environment. Like brass and aluminum, copper is not ferromagnetic. It's an expensive metal to work with, so it is largely used for decorative purposes. Outside of decoration, copper is most commonly
                encountered as the metal traces on circuit boards, due to its excellent ability to conduct electricity.

                Follows is a more in-depth overview of the tools we will be using and what they are generally used for.

            <p class="sample-text">
                    A <b>corded drill</b> is the only real power tool that we will be using in this class. While cordless drills get all the fanfare, corded drills give you the most bang for your buck - particularly for metalworking. You don't need to be particularly portable in the shop, and corded drills never run low on power. They also have a lot of torque, which is useful for metalworking. While they typically don't have all the fancy settings you may find on a cordless drill, these drills basically do one thing, and they do it very well..

            <p class="sample-text">
                    For this course you will only need a 7/64" <b>drill bit</b>. That said, you may as well invest in a basic drill bit set. This is just generally useful for metalworking. We will be discussing drill bits more in the drilling lesson.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="sample-text">
                    Another thing you will need is a 6-32 tap, and a tap handle wrench. This is used to thread drilled holes. We will be discussing this much more in the fastener lesson.

                    If it is solid, you can likely cut through it with a <b>hacksaw</b>. A hacksaw can cut through just about anything, it just may take a while. In this course, we will be cutting metal using a hacksaw. Aside from learning about how metal cuts in a hands-on manner, it should give you a healthy appreciation for power saws.   
            </p>

            <p class="sample-text">
                    A <b>table vise</b> is a handy tool when holding parts by hand won't cut it. For this course, a small vise that clamps onto the table will do (pictured). If you get deeper into metalworking, you will want to get one more heavy duty (preferably with a built-in anvil) that bolts onto your workbench.

            <p class="sample-text">
                    For more delicate shaping operations, a <b>hand file set</b> is much more useful than a hacksaw. Files come in a range of shapes, and sizes. They also have a range of cutting teeth arrangements to provide finer or rougher cuts in the metal. You may notice that my files here are all bastards. This does not mean they were forged out of wedlock, but have 30 teeth per inch (TPI). This is about an average tooth count, and good for general purpose use. There are countless configurations of files available for just about every imaginable purpose. Files are one of the most fundamental tools of metalworking, and are used in almost every aspect of metalworking for shaping and finishing parts. While filing metal may seem like a simple activity, it can take a lifetime to truly master.

            <p class="sample-text">
                    When you saw and drill metal, you leave behind sharp raised uneven edges called burrs. The <b>deburring tool</b> is designed to remove them. By dragging along the edge of the cut surface, the burr is simply scraped away. This leaves behind a nice smooth beveled edge in its place. We will go over this more in a bit. 
            </p>

            <p class="sample-text">
                    When metalworking, you will want a <b>hammer</b>. If you have a standard claw foot hammer at home already, that will be fine for now. However, for metalworking you will eventually want to invest in a ball peen hammer and a dead blow (both pictured above). A ball peen hammer has a striking surface on one side, and a ball on the other for shaping metal. This is much more useful than a generic claw hammer, since you will unlikely have any nails that will need removing. In addition, a dead blow has a counterweight inside of the striking head that minimizes rebound and translates most of the force downwards onto the surface being struck. This is useful for shaping metal (amongst other things).

            <p class="sample-text">
                    <b>Center punches</b> are used to mark the center of the hole you are trying to drill. When used correctly, they leave behind a small dimple that will keep your drill bit in place and prevent it from wandering. You shouldn't consider drilling metal without first center punching it.

            <p class="sample-text">
                    A <b>scriber</b> is used to leave a really light scratch on the surface of a metal part. This is used for marking cut and drill lines. This is preferably to pencil or marker because a scratch line is thinner, more accurate, and does not wear off easily.   
            </p>
            <div class="text-center mb-100">

            <p class="sample-text">
                    If you are going to making scribe lines on your metal, you are likely going to need to do some measuring. It is recommended you get <b>digital calipers</b> and a metal <b>ruler</b>. You have likely used a ruler before, but may have not use calipers. So, to explain, digital calipers have two jaws which slide back and forth upon a track. On the readout, it tells you the distance between the two jaws to a fraction of an inch. This is useful for making really precise measurements, which you often need to do for metal. Unlike softer materials such as wood or plastic, metal has no give. You need to be spot-on with your measurements.

                    For this course you will want to get wet/dry <b>sandpaper</b> in a variety of sizes from 220 up to 2000. This is a little different than normal dry sandpaper used for woodworking. The most important part, is that the paper is ber and doesn't rip as easily. We will be discussing sanding much more in the finishing section.

                    The buffing wheels we will be using in this class are shank-mounted and designed to go into a drill bit. They are basically a bunch of thin layers of fabric sandwiched together. It is the edge of the sandwiched fabric disc that is used to buff metal. This is yet another thing we will discuss more later.

                >When doing metalworking, it is unlikely you will be wearing all of the safety equipment at once like I am, but let's take a moment to discuss what you need:
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Eye protection</b>- You should always wear safety glasses, even if you are just using hand tools. These are a must.<br><br>
                <b>Dust mask </b>- A N95 dust mask should be worn when sanding, buffing or grinding metal.<br><br>
                <b>Safety gloves</b>- These can be worn when sanding to keep your hands clean. These should never be worn when handling rotary tools (any power tool that spins).<br><br>
                <b>Apron </b>- This is more for the safety of your clothing than your own personal safety. Stain removal is a drag.<br><br>
                <b>Ear Protection </b>-When using power tools or hammering, things can get loud. Passive noise canceling ear muffs are a great way to protect your hearing.
                </p>
                <div class="feature-img">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/metal_sk/metal21.jpg" alt="">
                 </div>
                 <p>
                     Aside from personal protective equipment, you will also want to get a basic first aid kit. This does not have to be anything too fancy. It should have materials to clean and dress scratches, cuts and bumps. Since we are not really using power tools, potential injuries will likely be on the more manageable side of the scale.
